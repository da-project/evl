Maintenance:
As the website depends on hugo and docsy, they sometimes must be updated. Docsy also depends on npm packages that must be sometimes updated: autoprefixer, postcss, postcss-cli.

Important note 16/07/21:
Docsy is broken after update of all the pre-cited components.
It can be solved: remove third argument true from the call to bg-gradient-variant (bootstrap function).

Deploy the site:
Simply call the script with the target evl source directory, e.g.:
$ ./deploy.sh ../
