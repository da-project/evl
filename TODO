Code
- hide helper/implementation classes, some methods that must remain package protected 
- implement toString method of MultiMethodD
- put the tutorials on web site
- test all errors : bad insertion, etc.
- refine perf tests to see if it would not be better to unfold invokeMethod call in invoke
- check the size of the application (with bounded cache)
- think about comparator copy by newInstance?

- recode Predicate without Method as DataType but the description of the method
=> break dependency to reflection

Tutorials
- Update web site
- Start examples (more concrete)
	Algorithms : calculate the descriptor of triangle, rectangle, hexagon
	- replace virtual inheritance by outside definitions
	- explain how visitor pattern would be used if not multi-method
	- replace in Method1
	- second Method1 for second algorithm
	- Method1 with simple argument enum to show the choice between algos
	- Method2 with additional value (completely dynamic)
	=> third party can add algo + type without code rewriting
	
	Dispatch
	- simple choice with instanceof
	=> replace any instanceof (with simplest code)
	=> explain reusability
	=> explain it is not type matching => BETTER more specialized !
	- simple message queue
	=> more complex
	=> explain reusability (key explanation)
	
- explain
	=> not a framework, can be used really often
	=> take the habit
	
- where to use
	=> avoid internal virtual methods
	=> code can be moved to the same class (it is better to move process functions in the same class)
	
remarks
- not implement resolve because potentially lots of classes
=> or imagine a base prototype
 
- Exception management
	- use runtime exceptions for insertion
	=> avoid too many compilation exceptions to treat that should be resolved once
	=> because we are using reflection layer
	
Web site:
Add index.html that let the choice between java and cpp implementations:

java:
Do like concurrentlinkedhashmap?
- Apache License 2.0
- provide link to bitbuckets web site (in Downloads & installation that will be renamed)
- remove Documentation
- javadoc
