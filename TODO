- hide helper/implementation classes, some methods that must remain package protected 
- implement toString method of MultiMethodD
- put the tutorials on web site
- test all errors : bad insertion, etc.
- refine perf tests to see if it would not be better to unfold invokeMethod call in invoke
- not implement resolve because potentially lots of classes
=> or imagine a base prototype
- check the size of the application (with bounded cache)
- think about comparator copy by newInstance?
